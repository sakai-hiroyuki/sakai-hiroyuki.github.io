## Abstract
This paper presents the Hager–Zhang (HZ)-type Riemannian conjugate gradient method that
uses the exponential retraction. We also present global convergence analyses of our
proposed method under two kinds of assumptions. Moreover, we numerically
compare our proposed methods with the existing methods by solving two kinds
of Riemannian optimization problems on the unit sphere. The numerical results
show that our proposed method has much better performance than the existing methods,
i.e., the FR, DY, PRP, and HS methods. In particular, they show that it
has much higher performance than existing methods including the hybrid ones
in computing the stability number of graphs problem.
