## Abstract
This paper presents Riemannian conjugate gradient methods
and global convergence analyses under the strong Wolfe conditions.
The main idea of the proposed methods is to combine the good global
convergence properties of the Dai–Yuan method with the efficient numerical
performance of the Hestenes–Stiefel method. One of the proposed algorithms
is a generalization to Riemannian manifolds of the hybrid conjugate
gradient method of the Dai and Yuan in Euclidean space. The proposed
methods are compared well numerically with the existing methods for
solving several Riemannian optimization problems.
Python implementations of the methods used in the numerical experiments
are available at https://github.com/iiduka-researches/202008-hybrid-rcg.
